## 🔍 How to Tell if You Have the Right URL:

**Good URL (Direct Image):**
```
https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1234567890.jpg?w=800
https://i.imgur.com/abc123.jpg
https://cdn.pexels.com/photos/123/photo.jpeg
```

**Bad URL (Webpage, not image):**
```
https://unsplash.com/photos/abc123 ❌
https://google.com/search?q=workout ❌
```

**How to Check:**
- Paste the URL in your browser address bar
- If you see ONLY the image (no webpage), it's good! ✅
- If you see a full webpage, that's wrong ❌

## 🎨 Best Search Terms:

**For Better Results:**
- "man bench press workout"
- "woman squats gym"
- "male deadlift exercise"
- "female shoulder press"
- "fitness training chest"
- "gym workout legs"

**Avoid:**

## 🐛 Troubleshooting:

**Image not showing in preview?**
